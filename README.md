# Mathy Bird - A Flappy Bird clone

Welcome to our COMP 580 Project - Mathy Bird. This game is a version of flapy bird that has been modified so the bird flaps through the pipes by giving the correct answer to simple math questions. We constructed this game so it can be played by people with motor impairments. 

The game is simple: Select the right answer to the math question before the bird passes through the selected number of pipes.
